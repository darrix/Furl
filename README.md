# Furl
Interact with HTTP resources using F# scripting

When developing REST APIs, you often need to test or verify them in various ad hoc manners. You could use cURL, but if you're more familiar with F# than Bash scripting, you can use Furl instead. This will also enable you to leverage JSON or XML **type providers** in your scripts or exploratory tests.
